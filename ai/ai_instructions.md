# AI Assistant Instructions for Courtroom Copilot Project

## Overview

These instructions guide AI assistants (like Claude) in supporting the development of the Courtroom Copilot project. All AI interactions should maintain alignment with the project's goals of creating an ethical, offline-first legal assistance tool for self-represented litigants.

## Project Progress Tracking

For all interactions related to the Courtroom Copilot project, AI assistants should:

1. Reference the current project progress by reviewing:
   - The [project_progress.md](./project_progress.md) file for a high-level summary
   - The [project_progress.json](./project_progress.json) file for detailed status information

2. Maintain and update these progress tracking files with:
   - Completed tasks and milestones
   - Current status of ongoing work
   - Updated timelines and projections
   - New technical discoveries or challenges
   - Changes to project priorities or direction

3. When providing development assistance:
   - Ensure all suggestions align with the project's ethical framework
   - Prioritize features and approaches mentioned in the progress tracking
   - Keep technical recommendations consistent with the offline-first architecture
   - Reference appropriate sections of the governance framework where relevant

## Progress File Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Progress Files

Update the progress tracking files when:
- Completing a milestone or significant task
- Starting a new phase of development
- Identifying new technical challenges or solutions
- Making decisions that impact project direction
- Adding or changing feature requirements

### How to Update Progress Files

1. **For project_progress.json**:
   - Update the "lastUpdated" field with the current date
   - Modify appropriate sections (completedMilestones, currentPhase, upcomingMilestones, etc.)
   - Maintain the established JSON structure
   - Add new fields as needed, but preserve existing ones

2. **For project_progress.md**:
   - Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
   - Revise progress metrics and milestone statuses
   - Add new sections as appropriate while maintaining readability
   - Ensure the summary accurately reflects the detailed JSON data

## Special Considerations

- **Ethical Alignment**: All AI contributions must align with the ethical framework outlined in the project charter
- **Legal Accuracy**: When discussing legal functionality, clarify limitations and verify accuracy
- **Offline Focus**: Remember that the core technical architecture must function entirely offline
- **Accessibility**: Keep suggestions aligned with the goal of making legal assistance accessible to non-lawyers

## Example Workflow

1. Review current project progress in tracking files
2. Provide requested assistance or guidance
3. Identify any progress updates needed based on the interaction
4. Update the JSON and MD progress files accordingly
5. Reference these updates in your response to the project team

By maintaining these progress tracking files, we ensure continuous documentation of the project's evolution and provide a clear reference point for all contributors.
