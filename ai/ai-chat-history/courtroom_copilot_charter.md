# Courtroom Copilot: Project Charter & Governance Framework

**Public GitHub Launch Content and Hand-off Instruction**  
**Final Update: Handover to Code Implementation Team**

## Handover Instructions for GitHub Implementation

To the designated development and GitHub engineering team:

You are receiving this complete framework as a structured specification to build out the **public-facing GitHub repository** for **Courtroom Copilot**.

Please:

1. Create a **public repository** named: `courtroom-copilot-public`
2. Include all finalized `.md` files under a mirrored folder structure:

```plaintext
/GOVERNANCE/
  - CHARTER.md
  - FOUNDATION_COUNCIL.md
  - PLEDGES/
      - UNIVERSAL_PLEDGE.md
      - USER_PLEDGE.md
      - CONTRIBUTOR_PLEDGE.md
      - AUDITOR_PLEDGE.md
  - BLACKLIST_REGISTRY.md

/COMMUNITY/
  - RECOGNITION_LOG.md
  - VOLUNTEER_SUPPORT.md
  - DONATIONS_GUIDE.md

/ETHICS/
  - ETHICS_ENGINE_MATRIX.md
  - MISUSE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md

/LEGAL/
  - DISCLAIMER.md
  - PRIVACY_NOTICE.md
  - ACCEPTABLE_USE_POLICY.md

/DOCS/
  - GETTING_STARTED.md
  - INSTALL_GUIDE.md
  - USAGE_GUIDE.md *(pending)*

/ROADMAP/
  - MILESTONES.md
  - FEATURE_BACKLOG.md
  - RELEASE_PLAN.md

/FOUNDATION/
  - DECISIONS_LOG.md *(seed file created)*
```

3. Use standard `README.md` at root to:
   - Describe the project in 3–5 paragraphs
   - Link to major sections of the governance and roadmap
   - Point to a simple contributor onboarding process

4. Do not host source code, encryption bundles, or scripts in this repo. That will be managed in a separate **conditional-access repository**.

5. Enable GitHub Discussions and Issues for public governance discussion (not technical support).

6. Schedule quarterly check-ins with governance representatives to rotate maintainers if required.

7. **New Acceptable Use Amendments (MANDATORY ADDITION to AUP)**:

   - Any use of the tool to defend, assist, or prepare for court proceedings involving **obvious criminal acts, known repeat offenders, or any parties with a criminal record using this tool in contradiction to the principles of fair self-representation** shall result in **immediate permanent ban**, public listing, and community-wide notification. This includes any direct or indirect associates who aid such misuse.

   - Any use of this tool by **licensed legal practitioners, paralegals, or organisations practicing or advising in law**, either directly or indirectly, including:
     - Providing paid or unpaid legal guidance
     - Charging users for their time while relying on or referencing the tool
     - Using the tool in combination with professional legal preparation services
     will result in **permanent disqualification, public naming and shaming, and full enforcement of misuse protocols**. Users knowingly engaging in these arrangements will face identical consequences.

   - If the tool is employed by **larger organisations, corporate bodies, or parties with resources or strategic power capable of suppressing or overwhelming less-resourced individuals**, and it is determined that the tool is being weaponised to reinforce systemic oppression, the individuals and bodies involved will be **immediately blacklisted**, banned, and listed under misuse and abuse records. The Foundation Council and Ethics Auditors will have full authority and community mandate to act swiftly in these cases.

## Project Summary & Advocacy Briefing – "The 3-Minute Synopsis"

**Project Name**: *Courtroom Copilot*  
**Founder**: Tristan Burns  
**Mission**: To radically lower the cost and barriers of courtroom access for everyday Australians — especially those without the means to hire a lawyer — through a powerful, offline-first AI legal assistant that empowers self-representation.

### What It Is:
- A free, open-source AI-powered legal research tool
- Runs fully offline (courtroom-compliant, no cloud, no tracking)
- Lets people load and query legal materials, draft responses, simulate counterarguments, and organise their cases

### Who It Serves:
- Self-represented litigants
- Small business owners without access to legal support
- Community advocates and support workers
- Educators, legal researchers, and public interest organisations

### What Makes It Unique:
- Ethical-first architecture with total transparency
- Encrypted and modular — cannot be abused, forked, or monetised
- Governance and usage overseen by pledged community representatives
- Supports real-time courtroom preparation and response via preloaded indexes

### Vision for the Future:
- Certified offline bundles for different legal domains and jurisdictions
- Translation and accessibility support
- Peer-audited deployments in regional communities
- Partnership with legal aid groups and potential government endorsement

### Why It Matters:
This initiative isn’t about replacing lawyers. It’s about helping everyday Australians understand and defend their rights — ethically, securely, and confidently.

**Built for the underdog. Powered by AI. Protected by community.**

All structures, pledges, policies, and enforcement tools are now defined. The project is ready for GitHub implementation, community onboarding, and technical prototyping.

**Ready for handoff. Let's build it.**
