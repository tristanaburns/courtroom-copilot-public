# Courtroom Copilot: Project Progress Summary

*Last Updated: May 3, 2025*

## Project Overview

Courtroom Copilot is an open-source AI-powered legal assistant designed to empower self-represented litigants in Australian courtrooms. The project aims to lower barriers to legal access through a powerful, offline-first tool that functions inside and outside courtrooms while maintaining strict ethical standards.

## Current Status: Early Development

The project is currently in early development, with significant progress made on establishing the governance framework and documentation. The technical implementation is still in the planning phase, with development scheduled to begin in the coming months.

## Key Progress Metrics

- **Overall Completion**: 35%
- **Current Phase**: Governance Framework Implementation (85% complete)
- **Active Contributors**: 3
- **Target for Initial Release**: April 2026

## Completed Milestones

- ✅ Project Charter Creation (April 25, 2025)
- ✅ GitHub Repository Setup (April 28, 2025)
- ✅ Basic Directory Structure Implementation (May 3, 2025)
- ✅ Core Documentation Creation (May 3, 2025)

## Recent Accomplishments

As of May 3, 2025, we have completed significant documentation across all major project areas:

- **Ethics Framework**: Created Ethics Engine Matrix and Misuse Report Template
- **Legal Documentation**: Developed Disclaimer, Privacy Notice, and Acceptable Use Policy
- **Community Resources**: Established Recognition Log, Volunteer Support, and Donations Guide
- **Roadmap Details**: Defined Milestones, Feature Backlog, and Release Plan
- **Foundation Governance**: Implemented Decisions Log
- **User Documentation**: Created Getting Started and Installation guides

## Identified Gaps and Enhancements

A comprehensive review of the project has identified several areas requiring attention:

1. **Missing Documentation**:
   - USAGE_GUIDE.md in DOCS directory
   - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in GOVERNANCE directory
   - FAQ.md in DOCS directory
   - Technical documentation across all components

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - README.md needs visual elements and quickstart guide
   - Need technical architecture documentation
   - Community engagement materials can be enhanced

3. **New Structural Needs**:
   - Creation of TECHNICAL directory for implementation guidance
   - Visual assets for project branding
   - Development environment documentation

## Todo List for Next Phase

### Priority 1: Complete Core Documentation
- [ ] Create USAGE_GUIDE.md in DOCS directory
- [ ] Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in GOVERNANCE directory
- [ ] Create FAQ.md in DOCS directory
- [ ] Enhance README.md with visual elements and quickstart

### Priority 2: Establish Technical Framework
- [ ] Create TECHNICAL directory for architecture documentation
- [ ] Develop ARCHITECTURE.md with system design principles
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md for technical contributors
- [ ] Document offline AI approach in OFFLINE_MODEL.md
- [ ] Create SECURITY.md detailing security model

### Priority 3: Enhance Community Engagement
- [ ] Create EVENTS.md for community activities
- [ ] Enhance RECOGNITION_LOG.md with contribution categories
- [ ] Develop visual identity and branding materials

### Priority 4: Prepare for Implementation
- [ ] Create technical prototyping plan
- [ ] Document data structures and relationships
- [ ] Establish development environment setup guide
- [ ] Create testing framework documentation

## Upcoming Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Documentation Completion | May 15, 2025 | Planning |
| Technical Architecture Design | June 1, 2025 | Planning |
| Developer Documentation | June 15, 2025 | Not Started |
| Community Onboarding | June 15, 2025 | Not Started |
| AI Core Development | July 15, 2025 | Not Started |

## Technical Components Status

- **AI Core**: In planning phase, researching offline-compatible models
- **Offline Operation**: Concept definition in progress
- **Legal Domain Modules**: Researching priority domains
- **User Interface**: Initial concept development
- **Document Generation**: Exploring template-based systems
- **Case Management**: Defining data structures

## Risks and Challenges

- Technical complexity of implementing fully offline AI capabilities
- Ensuring legal accuracy while maintaining usability for non-lawyers
- Volunteer retention and engagement
- Preventing misuse by prohibited users
- **New Risk**: Gap between governance and technical implementation

## Next Steps

The project will focus on completing core documentation and establishing the technical framework over the next 30 days. This will include creating all missing documentation and developing the architectural guidelines that will inform technical implementation.

Following this documentation phase, we will begin establishing the development environment and creating initial technical prototypes for the offline AI functionality.
