# Courtroom Copilot: Project Summary

## Project Summary & Advocacy Briefing – "The 3-Minute Synopsis"

**Project Name**: *Courtroom Copilot*  
**Founder**: Tristan Burns  
**Mission**: To radically lower the cost and barriers of courtroom access for everyday Australians — especially those without the means to hire a lawyer — through a powerful, offline-first AI legal assistant that empowers self-representation.

### What It Is:
- A free, open-source AI-powered legal research tool
- Runs fully offline (courtroom-compliant, no cloud, no tracking)
- Lets people load and query legal materials, draft responses, simulate counterarguments, and organise their cases

### Who It Serves:
- Self-represented litigants
- Small business owners without access to legal support
- Community advocates and support workers
- Educators, legal researchers, and public interest organisations

### What Makes It Unique:
- Ethical-first architecture with total transparency
- Encrypted and modular — cannot be abused, forked, or monetised
- Governance and usage overseen by pledged community representatives
- Supports real-time courtroom preparation and response via preloaded indexes

### Vision for the Future:
- Certified offline bundles for different legal domains and jurisdictions
- Translation and accessibility support
- Peer-audited deployments in regional communities
- Partnership with legal aid groups and potential government endorsement

### Why It Matters:
This initiative isn't about replacing lawyers. It's about helping everyday Australians understand and defend their rights — ethically, securely, and confidently.
