# Privacy Notice

*How Courtroom Copilot handles your data*

## Our Privacy Commitment

Courtroom Copilot is designed with privacy as a foundational principle. Unlike conventional legal tech tools, our software operates entirely locally on your device, with no data transmission to external servers for processing, storage, or analysis.

This privacy notice explains our approach to data handling and the technical measures implemented to protect user privacy.

## Data Collection: None

**Courtroom Copilot does not collect any user data.** Specifically, we do not:

- Collect personal information
- Track usage patterns
- Monitor query content
- Analyze document uploads
- Implement analytics or telemetry
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Maintain user accounts or profiles
- Record device information

## Local Processing & Storage

All data processing occurs exclusively on your local device:

1. **Case Information**: Any case details, notes, or custom data you input remains solely on your device.

2. **Documents**: Files you upload or create are stored only in your local file system.

3. **Queries & Responses**: All interactions with the AI assistant are processed locally by the on-device model without external communication.

4. **Legal References**: The legal databases and reference materials are downloaded once during installation or module updates, then accessed locally.

## Optional Anonymous Usage Statistics

You may optionally enable basic anonymous usage statistics to help improve the software. If enabled:

- Only non-identifying information is collected (e.g., "Feature X was used Y times")
- No content from your legal cases or queries is transmitted
- Data is anonymized and aggregated before transmission
- You can disable this feature at any time via Settings

This feature is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled by the user.

## Technical Privacy Protections

We implement multiple technical safeguards to ensure privacy:

1. **Network Controls**: The application includes network isolation capabilities that can block all outbound connections.

2. **Courtroom Mode**: When activated, this mode enforces complete network disconnection to comply with courtroom technology restrictions.

3. **Local AI**: Our offline-first design uses on-device machine learning models that don't require internet access to function.

4. **Document Encryption**: Local encryption for case files and documents is available as an optional security feature.

5. **Verification System**: Digital signatures verify the integrity of application components without requiring data transmission.

## Third-Party Components

Courtroom Copilot incorporates some third-party open-source components, none of which transmit user data:

- **AI Models**: Pre-trained models included with the software operate entirely offline.
- **Legal Databases**: Reference materials are downloaded during installation and accessed locally.
- **UI Framework**: Standard open-source components with network functionality disabled.

We regularly audit dependencies to ensure they maintain our privacy standards.

## Updates & Module Downloads

The only time Courtroom Copilot connects to external servers is for:

1. Checking for software updates
2. Downloading legal domain modules when requested
3. Verifying module integrity through cryptographic signatures

These connections:
- Are initiated only with explicit user consent
- Do not transmit any user data, case information, or queries
- Can be performed on a separate device if required (via export/import)

## Data Retention & Deletion

Since all data remains on your device:

1. Data retention is entirely under your control
2. You can delete case files and documents through the application interface
3. Complete uninstallation removes all application data from your system

## Changes to This Privacy Notice

This privacy notice may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the software or privacy practices. Updates will be provided through the application and GitHub repository.
