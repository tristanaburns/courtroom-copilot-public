# Courtroom Copilot

## Empowering Self-Representation through AI

**Courtroom Copilot** is a free, open-source AI-powered legal assistant designed to radically lower the cost and barriers of courtroom access for everyday Australians — especially those without the means to hire a lawyer.

The project provides a powerful, offline-first AI legal assistant that functions inside and outside courtrooms. It offers real-time legal reference, response drafting, and scenario simulation while being compliant with courtroom technology restrictions (no internet, no cloud services).

With Courtroom Copilot, self-represented litigants can load and query legal materials, draft responses, simulate counterarguments, and organize their cases, all while maintaining privacy and security through a completely offline experience.
