## Founding Decisions

### ID: 20250425-01
**Date**: April 25, 2025  
**Title**: Establishment of Courtroom Copilot Project  
**Category**: Strategic  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council formally establishes the Courtroom Copilot project as an open-source initiative to increase access to justice through offline-first AI legal assistance for self-represented litigants, with a focus on serving those without the means to hire legal representation.

**Context**:  
Australia faces a significant justice gap, with legal representation inaccessible to many due to cost barriers. Self-represented litigants face substantial disadvantages in navigating the complex legal system. Existing legal tech solutions often require internet connectivity (prohibited in courtrooms), collect user data, or are priced beyond reach of those most in need.

**Implications**:
- Creation of a public GitHub repository for governance and documentation
- Development of an open-source, offline-first AI legal assistant
- Establishment of ethical guidelines to prevent exploitation
- Formation of community governance structures
- Focus on Australian legal system initially, with potential for expansion

**Voting Record**:  
Unanimous approval (7/7)

**Review Date**: April 25, 2026 (Annual review)

### ID: 20250425-02
**Date**: April 25, 2025  
**Title**: Adoption of Core Ethical Principles  
**Category**: Ethical  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council adopts four core ethical principles that will guide all aspects of the project: Access to Justice, Fairness and Equality, Transparency and Accountability, and Safety and Responsibility.

**Context**:  
To ensure Courtroom Copilot remains aligned with its mission of increasing access to justice while preventing misuse, a formal ethical framework is necessary. These principles will inform technical design, governance processes, and usage guidelines.

**Implications**:
- Development of a comprehensive Ethics Engine Matrix
- Implementation of safeguards against exploitation by well-resourced parties
- Creation of User Pledge and usage monitoring systems
- Regular ethical audits of the platform and its applications
- Establishment of transparent decision-making processes

**Voting Record**:  
Unanimous approval (7/7)

**Review Date**: October 25, 2025 (Semi-annual review)

### ID: 20250425-03
**Date**: April 25, 2025  
**Title**: Approval of Initial Project Charter  
**Category**: Governance  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council approves the initial Project Charter as the foundational governance document for Courtroom Copilot, establishing its mission, scope, governance structure, and core commitments.

**Context**:  
A formal charter is necessary to provide clarity on the project's purpose, principles, and processes. This charter will serve as the reference point for resolving disputes, evaluating contributions, and guiding future development.

**Implications**:
- Publication of the Charter in the GitHub repository
- Formation of governance bodies as specified in the Charter
- Implementation of contribution and review processes
- Development of additional governance documents (pledges, policies)
- Regular reviews and potential amendments to the Charter

**Voting Record**:  
6 approve, 1 abstain

**Review Date**: April 25, 2026 (Annual review)

## Technical Decisions

### ID: 20250503-01
**Date**: May 3, 2025  
**Title**: Adoption of Offline-First Architecture  
**Category**: Technical  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council mandates an offline-first architecture for Courtroom Copilot, requiring all core functionality to operate without internet connectivity and with zero data transmission to external servers.

**Context**:  
Many courtrooms prohibit internet-connected devices, creating a significant barrier for digital legal assistance tools. Additionally, privacy concerns regarding sensitive legal data necessitate a local-first approach to protect user confidentiality.

**Implications**:
- Development of locally-running AI models
- Local storage for all user data and documents
- On-device processing of all queries and responses
- Module-based architecture for legal domains
- Clear indicators of offline vs online operation
- Potential initial limitations in model capabilities

**Voting Record**:  
Unanimous approval (7/7)

**Review Date**: November 3, 2025 (6-month review)

## Ethical Decisions

### ID: 20250503-02
**Date**: May 3, 2025  
**Title**: Prohibition of Commercial and Professional Legal Use  
**Category**: Ethical  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council explicitly prohibits the use of Courtroom Copilot by legal professionals in their practice, commercial legal service providers, or well-resourced entities against individuals, with enforcement mechanisms including blacklisting and public notification of violators.

**Context**:  
Courtroom Copilot is designed specifically to address the justice gap for those who cannot afford legal representation. Use by legal professionals or commercial entities would contradict this mission and potentially exacerbate existing power imbalances in the legal system.

**Implications**:
- Creation of an Acceptable Use Policy with explicit prohibitions
- Development of monitoring and reporting mechanisms
- Establishment of the Blacklist Registry for violators
- Implementation of technical measures to discourage prohibited use
- Regular audits to identify potential misuse patterns

**Voting Record**:  
5 approve, 1 against, 1 abstain

**Review Date**: August 3, 2025 (Quarterly review)

## Legal Decisions

### ID: 20250503-03
**Date**: May 3, 2025  
**Title**: Adoption of Comprehensive Disclaimer Requirements  
**Category**: Legal  

**Decision**:  
The Foundation Council mandates that Courtroom Copilot must display clear, prominent disclaimers about its limitations, the fact that it does not provide legal advice, and the absence of an attorney-client relationship, with user acknowledgment required before use.

**Context**:  
To prevent misunderstanding about Courtroom Copilot's role and to mitigate legal risks, explicit disclaimers are necessary. Users must clearly understand that the tool is an assistive resource, not a replacement for legal advice.

**Implications**:
- Development of a comprehensive legal disclaimer
- Implementation of mandatory acknowledgment flows
- Integration of contextual disclaimers within the application interface
- Clear boundaries on what constitutes legal advice vs. information
- Regular review and updating of disclaimer language

**Voting Record**:  
Unanimous approval (7/7)

**Review Date**: May 3, 2026 (Annual review)
