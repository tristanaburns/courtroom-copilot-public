## Project Summary & Advocacy Briefing – "The 3-Minute Synopsis"

**Project Name**: *Courtroom Copilot*  
**Founder**: Tristan Burns  
**Mission**: To radically lower the cost and barriers of courtroom access for everyday Australians — especially those without the means to hire a lawyer — through a powerful, offline-first AI legal assistant that empowers self-representation.

### What It Is:
- A free, open-source AI-powered legal research tool
- Runs fully offline (courtroom-compliant, no cloud, no tracking)
- Lets people load and query legal materials, draft responses, simulate counterarguments, and organise their cases

### Who It Serves:
- Self-represented litigants
- Small business owners without access to legal support
- Community advocates and support workers
- Educators, legal researchers, and public interest organisations

### What Makes It Unique:
- Ethical-first architecture with total transparency
- Encrypted and modular — cannot be abused, forked, or monetised
- Governance and usage overseen by pledged community representatives
- Supports real-time courtroom preparation and response via preloaded indexes

### Vision for the Future:
- Certified offline bundles for different legal domains and jurisdictions
- Translation and accessibility support
- Peer-audited deployments in regional communities
- Partnership with legal aid groups and potential government endorsement

### Why It Matters:
This initiative isn't about replacing lawyers. It's about helping everyday Australians understand and defend their rights — ethically, securely, and confidently.

**Built for the underdog. Powered by AI. Protected by community.**

## System Architecture & Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- Load and parse Acts, codes, policies, contracts, transcripts, case law
- Natural language querying of legal information
- Real-time voice-to-text query option
- "What If" Simulator for legal argument planning
- Instant access to pre-written responses, rebuttals, citations
- Save and retrieve response sets for continuity
- Multi-user, multi-device deployment
- Data sharing across LAN
- Scenario generation and brief export tools

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Must run on high-performance consumer laptop (32GB RAM, RTX 4080+)
- Must not connect to the internet during court sessions
- Encrypted local storage
- Modular Docker deployment per legal domain
- Peer-to-peer LAN sync for teams
- CLI and GUI support
- Secure document handling and restoration

### Architecture & Workflow:
1. **LLM Engine Layer**
   - Containers per legal domain (ACL, Contract Law, Civil Procedure, etc.)
   - RAG implementation using FAISS or ChromaDB

2. **Frontend Interface**
   - CLI interface with optional GUI dashboard
   - Optional Whisper-based speech recognition
   - Optional TTS with Coqui or Piper

3. **Document and Law Loader**
   - Chunking and indexing of legal docs
   - Accepts PDF, DOCX, HTML, TXT, etc.
   - Extracts clause-level metadata for fast querying

4. **Scenario and Response Planner**
   - Map opposing claims
   - Simulate rebuttals
   - Store pre-approved responses for real-time use

5. **Multi-Device Collaboration**
   - Mesh LAN discovery (ZeroConf/mDNS)
   - Shared document and index state
   - Devices with assigned roles (evidence, case law, live argument, etc.)
   - Real-time response flagging and cross-highlighting

6. **Data Storage & Security**
   - Encrypted file store per case/project
   - Indexable embeddings using UUID + Hash
   - Journaling for audit and replay
   - Manual approval workflows for external data

7. **Hybrid Integration with Internet-Facing LLMs**
   - Preload Mode for research during recess
   - Extract answers in structured JSON/Markdown
   - Sanitize, tag, and ingest responses into RAG store
   - Manual QA before loading into active knowledge base

## Governance Principles

1. **Ethical Use Only**: The system will never be used to defend parties engaged in obvious criminal acts or to assist repeat offenders.

2. **Transparency**: All system operations and recommendations must be explainable and transparent.

3. **Accessibility**: The tool remains free and open-source, ensuring access for those who need it most.

4. **Community Oversight**: Governance and usage are overseen by pledged community representatives.

5. **No Commercial Exploitation**: Licensed legal practitioners, paralegals, or organizations cannot use this tool for commercial purposes.

6. **Protection Against Power Imbalance**: The system will not be weaponized by powerful entities against less-resourced individuals.
