# Blacklist Registry

## Purpose and Scope

The Blacklist Registry exists to document individuals, organizations, and entities that have been restricted from using, contributing to, or otherwise engaging with the Courtroom Copilot project due to serious violations of our pledges, ethical guidelines, or acceptable use policies.

This registry serves several important functions:

1. **Transparency**: Providing clear documentation of enforcement actions
2. **Accountability**: Ensuring consistent application of community standards
3. **Protection**: Safeguarding the project's mission and the vulnerable populations it serves
4. **Education**: Illustrating concrete examples of prohibited behavior

## Registry Format

Each entry in the blacklist includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Entity Type** | Individual, Organization, or Entity |
| **Identifier** | Public-facing identifier (not personal data) |
| **Date Added** | When the restriction was enacted |
| **Restriction Level** | Partial/Full, Temporary/Permanent |
| **Violation Category** | Reference to specific pledge/policy violation |
| **Justification** | Summary of evidence and reasoning |
| **Decision Reference** | Link to Foundation Council decision |
| **Review Date** | When applicable for temporary restrictions |

## Current Blacklist

*The registry is currently empty. This is a good thing! We hope to maintain an empty registry through clear guidelines, proactive education, and a supportive community culture.*

## Blacklisting Process

The process for adding an entity to the blacklist includes:

1. **Investigation**: The Foundation Council investigates reported violations
2. **Evidence Review**: Documentation and verification of violations
3. **Deliberation**: Council discussion of appropriate action
4. **Decision**: Formal vote requiring 2/3 majority
5. **Notification**: When possible, direct notification to affected parties
6. **Publication**: Addition to the registry with appropriate documentation
7. **Appeal Process**: Clear path for requesting reconsideration

## Restriction Levels

| Level | Description | Typical Use Case |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Temporary Limited** | Specific restrictions for 1-6 months | First-time minor violations |
| **Temporary Full** | Complete restriction for 1-12 months | Serious violations with remediation potential |
| **Permanent Limited** | Ongoing specific restrictions | Partial rehabilitation after serious violation |
| **Permanent Full** | Complete and permanent restriction | Fundamental opposition to project principles |

## Removal Process

For temporary restrictions, automatic expiry occurs on the review date unless the Foundation Council votes to extend the restriction. For permanent restrictions, removal requires:

1. Formal appeal with evidence of rehabilitation
2. Public community discussion period
3. 3/4 majority vote from the Foundation Council

## Privacy Considerations

This registry strives to balance transparency with privacy:

- Focuses on entities and actions, not personal details
- Provides sufficient information for accountability
- Complies with relevant privacy laws and regulations
- Allows for redaction of unnecessary identifying information
