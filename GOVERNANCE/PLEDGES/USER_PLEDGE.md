# User Pledge for Courtroom Copilot

This pledge applies to all users of the Courtroom Copilot system. By using this tool, you acknowledge and commit to these principles beyond the Universal Pledge.

## As a User of Courtroom Copilot, I Pledge:

### Ethical Representation

1. I will use this tool only for genuine self-representation or to assist others who cannot access traditional legal support.

2. I affirm that I am not a licensed legal practitioner, paralegal, or organization practicing or advising in law using this tool for commercial purposes.

3. I understand that this tool is designed to empower individuals who cannot afford legal representation, not to supplement or enhance existing legal practices.

4. I will not use the tool to create or support frivolous, vexatious, or harassing legal actions.

### Truthful Engagement

1. I will provide truthful information when using the system and will not deliberately mislead the tool to generate false or biased outputs.

2. I acknowledge that the quality of assistance depends on the accuracy of the information I provide.

3. I will not use the system to fabricate evidence, misrepresent facts, or create deceptive legal arguments.

### Responsible Usage

1. I recognize that the Courtroom Copilot is an assistive tool, not a replacement for a lawyer, and its suggestions require my critical judgment.

2. I will use the system's guidance as a starting point for my own research and understanding, not as definitive legal advice.

3. I will verify important legal information through authoritative sources when stakes are high.

4. I will not share, sell, or distribute any specialized legal bundles or software components in violation of the project's licensing.

### Feedback and Improvement

1. I will report any issues, inaccuracies, or potential improvements I discover while using the system.

2. I will provide constructive feedback about my experience to help improve the tool for others.

3. If I discover a way the system could be misused, I will responsibly disclose this information to the project maintainers.

### Community Respect

1. I will be mindful that I am part of a community of users who share similar needs and challenges.

2. I will respect community guidelines in forums, discussions, and support channels.

3. I will share helpful insights with other users when appropriate, while respecting privacy and confidentiality.

## User Accountability

By using Courtroom Copilot, I understand that:

1. Evidence of misuse may result in my access being restricted or revoked.

2. Deliberate violation of these pledges may result in being added to the project blacklist.

3. I may be asked to reaffirm this pledge periodically as the system and community evolve.
