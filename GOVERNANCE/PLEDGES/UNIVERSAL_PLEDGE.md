# Universal Pledge for Courtroom Copilot

This Universal Pledge represents the core commitments that all participants in the Courtroom Copilot ecosystem - whether users, contributors, or auditors - agree to uphold. By engaging with the Courtroom Copilot project in any capacity, you commit to these principles.

## Our Shared Commitments

### Ethical Use

1. I pledge to use Courtroom Copilot solely for legitimate legal self-representation or supporting those who cannot afford traditional legal representation.

2. I will never use this tool to defend, assist, or prepare for court proceedings involving criminal acts, repeat offenders, or parties using the tool in contradiction to the principles of fair self-representation.

3. I recognize that Courtroom Copilot exists to empower individuals facing systemic disadvantages in accessing justice, not to create new imbalances.

### Truth and Accuracy

1. I will strive for factual accuracy and truthfulness in all interactions with and through the system.

2. I will not deliberately mislead the AI or manipulate it to produce false or misleading information.

3. I will report any instances where the system produces inaccurate, biased, or legally unsound guidance.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

1. I support the principle that justice should be accessible to all, regardless of financial means, technical proficiency, or educational background.

2. I will respect the diverse needs, backgrounds, and perspectives of all community members.

3. I will work to ensure the tool remains accessible to those who need it most.

### Community and Collaboration

1. I recognize that I am part of a community working together to improve access to justice.

2. I will engage respectfully with other community members, even when disagreements arise.

3. I will share knowledge, insights, and improvements that could benefit other users within the community guidelines.

### Privacy and Security

1. I will respect the privacy of all individuals involved and will not misuse personal or sensitive information.

2. I will follow security best practices when using or contributing to the system.

3. I will report any security or privacy concerns through appropriate channels.

## Pledge Enforcement

By using, contributing to, or auditing Courtroom Copilot, I understand that:

1. Violations of this pledge may result in restrictions or removal from the community.

2. The Foundation Council has final authority on interpreting and enforcing this pledge.

3. This pledge may evolve through community governance processes, and I will stay informed of any changes.
