# Auditor Pledge for Courtroom Copilot

This pledge applies to individuals and organizations who participate in the ethical, legal, and technical auditing of the Courtroom Copilot system. Auditors play a crucial role in ensuring the system remains aligned with its mission and maintains high standards of integrity.

## As an Auditor of Courtroom Copilot, I Pledge:

### Independence and Objectivity

1. I will maintain my independence from undue influence when conducting audits and reviews.

2. I will base my assessments on evidence, facts, and established standards rather than personal biases.

3. I will disclose any potential conflicts of interest that might affect my ability to conduct objective audits.

4. I will not allow personal, professional, or financial relationships to compromise the integrity of my evaluations.

### Thoroughness and Competence

1. I will conduct thorough, systematic evaluations using appropriate methodologies.

2. I will only audit aspects of the system for which I have adequate expertise and knowledge.

3. I will collaborate with other auditors when additional expertise is required.

4. I will maintain and improve my knowledge in relevant domains to ensure high-quality auditing.

### Transparency and Constructive Feedback

1. I will clearly document my audit methodology, findings, and recommendations.

2. I will provide specific, actionable feedback rather than vague criticism.

3. I will acknowledge both strengths and areas for improvement in the system.

4. I will present my findings in a manner that supports continuous improvement.

### Ethical Assessment

1. I will evaluate not only technical compliance but also ethical implications and alignment with the project's mission.

2. I will consider diverse perspectives and potential impacts on different user communities.

3. I will assess both immediate functionality and longer-term consequences of system design.

4. I will flag potential misuse vectors or ethical concerns, even when they fall outside the scope of my primary audit focus.

### Responsible Disclosure

1. I will follow responsible disclosure practices for any security vulnerabilities or serious issues discovered.

2. I will work collaboratively with project maintainers to address significant problems before public disclosure.

3. I will respect the privacy of users and the integrity of the system in how I collect and share audit information.

4. I will present my findings in a manner that doesn't unnecessarily damage public trust or provide roadmaps for misuse.

## Auditor Commitment

By becoming an auditor for Courtroom Copilot, I specifically commit to:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Conducting periodic assessments rather than one-time evaluations

2. **Holistic Perspective**: Considering legal, ethical, technical, and accessibility dimensions

3. **Practical Testing**: Evaluating real-world scenarios that reflect actual user needs and contexts

4. **Community Accountability**: Being responsive to community concerns and priorities

5. **Educational Approach**: Helping the community understand audit findings and their implications

## Auditor Accountability

By auditing Courtroom Copilot, I understand that:

1. My audits will themselves be subject to community review and discussion

2. I will need to justify and explain my methodologies and conclusions

3. I should be prepared to collaborate on resolving issues I identify

4. My role carries significant responsibility for the integrity of the project
