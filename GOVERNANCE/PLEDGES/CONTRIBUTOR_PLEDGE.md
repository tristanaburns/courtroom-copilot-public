# Contributor Pledge for Courtroom Copilot

This pledge applies to all contributors to the Courtroom Copilot project, including developers, documentation writers, testers, and anyone submitting code or content to the repository. It builds upon the Universal Pledge with specific commitments for those helping to build the system.

## As a Contributor to Courtroom Copilot, I Pledge:

### Ethical Development

1. I will prioritize ethical considerations in all design, coding, and implementation decisions.

2. I will work to prevent potential misuse of the system and will not knowingly introduce features that could enable unethical applications.

3. I will respect user privacy and security in all code contributions and design decisions.

4. I understand that this tool must remain free, open-source, and accessible to those who need it most.

### Quality and Reliability

1. I will strive for high-quality, well-tested code that contributes to a reliable system users can depend on in high-stress situations.

2. I will document my contributions thoroughly, enabling others to understand, maintain, and improve upon my work.

3. I will follow project coding standards, security best practices, and accessibility guidelines.

4. I recognize that users may make critical decisions based on this tool, so accuracy and reliability are paramount.

### Legal Accuracy

1. I will take reasonable care to ensure that any legal information or logic I implement is accurate and properly sourced.

2. I will clearly mark any legal content I contribute with appropriate jurisdictional limitations.

3. I will not contribute legal content outside my areas of knowledge without proper review.

4. I understand the distinction between providing legal information and legal advice, and will design accordingly.

### Community Collaboration

1. I will engage respectfully with other contributors, acknowledging diverse perspectives and experiences.

2. I will provide constructive feedback on others' contributions and be open to receiving feedback on my own.

3. I will help maintain a welcoming environment for contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds.

4. I will participate in governance processes constructively and transparently.

### Responsible Implementation

1. I will ensure my code cannot easily be modified to circumvent ethical safeguards.

2. I will implement appropriate error handling and user warnings for potentially problematic scenarios.

3. I will help document potential limitations of the system to reduce harmful overreliance.

4. I will not deliberately introduce dependencies that compromise the system's offline functionality, privacy, or freedom.

## Implementation Guidelines

As a contributor, I also specifically commit to:

1. **Performance Consideration**: Optimizing code to run on accessible hardware where possible

2. **Modularity**: Creating components that can be reused, extended, and easily maintained

3. **Security-First Design**: Implementing security best practices from the ground up

4. **Transparent Documentation**: Clearly documenting how algorithms work and decisions are made

5. **Accessibility**: Designing with accessibility in mind for users with diverse needs

## Contributor Accountability

By contributing to Courtroom Copilot, I understand that:

1. My contributions will undergo review for alignment with these principles

2. I may be asked to modify contributions that don't align with these commitments

3. Repeated or deliberate violations of this pledge may result in restrictions on my participation
