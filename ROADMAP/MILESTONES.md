## Milestone Revision Process

This roadmap is a living document that will be revised:

- Quarterly by the Foundation Council
- In response to significant technical or resource developments
- Based on community feedback and contribution capacity
- To address emerging legal system needs

Proposed revisions will be discussed publicly and documented in the [Decisions Log](../FOUNDATION/DECISIONS_LOG.md).
