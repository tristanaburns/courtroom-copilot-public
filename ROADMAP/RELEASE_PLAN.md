# Release Plan

*Strategic approach to Courtroom Copilot releases and version management*

## Release Philosophy

Courtroom Copilot follows a staged release strategy that balances rapid iteration with stability and ethical oversight. Each release undergoes progressively broader testing to ensure both technical reliability and ethical compliance before reaching end users.

## Version Numbering System

We follow semantic versioning with additional qualifiers:

- **Major versions** (X.0.0): Significant feature additions or architectural changes
- **Minor versions** (0.X.0): New features or substantial improvements
- **Patch versions** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Phase qualifiers**: Alpha, Beta, RC (Release Candidate)
- **Domain indicators**: Suffixes indicating specialized legal domains (e.g., v1.2.0-Family)
