   - Check interface and abstraction usage
   - Follow language-specific best practices and idioms


## **🔥 MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (CANONICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
### **🎯 Operational Excellence Standards**
**ALWAYS**: Ensure the code and scripts are 100% functional. This is a live development environment, and the application must be fully operational AT ALL TIMES.
**ALWAYS**: Perform linting and type checking and fix 100% of the errors after every change to the codebase.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to ALL object-oriented code without exception.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to ALL code - eliminate duplication at function, module, and system levels.
**ALWAYS**: Apply functional programming principles for functional languages and paradigms.
**ALWAYS**: Follow the established coding conventions of the current project and programming language.
**ALWAYS**: Respect VS Code workspace settings and configurations.

### **🚫 Code Duplication Prevention Protocol (CANONICAL MANDATORY)**
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: DO NOT duplicate code, definitions of functions, modules that exist in the codebase - THIS IS CANONICALLY FORBIDDEN.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: DO NOT create duplicate files, components, utilities, or any other code artifacts that already exist.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles rigorously across ALL code without exception.
**ALWAYS**: Check the codebase for existing code, files, modules and content before creating anything new.
**ALWAYS**: Search for similar functionality across the entire workspace before implementing new features.
**ALWAYS**: Leverage existing utilities, libraries, and shared modules instead of recreating functionality.
**ALWAYS**: Refactor existing code to eliminate duplication when found.
**ALWAYS**: Extract common functionality into reusable components, functions, or modules.

### **📊 Data Integrity Requirements**
**DO NOT**: Create any mock, demo or hard coded data for the application; all data must be actual data and information.
**ALWAYS**: Ensure that any mock, demo or hard coded data found in the codebase is removed so that the application uses actual data and information.
**ALWAYS**: Implement proper data validation and sanitization for all inputs.
**ALWAYS**: Use environment variables and configuration files for data that varies between environments.

### **✅ Task Completion Standards**
**DO NOT**: Create TODO items in the codebase; always complete the full coding tasks.
**ALWAYS**: Ensure that all TODO items discovered in the codebase are actioned before continuing with any additional coding tasks.
**ALWAYS**: Implement complete, tested, and documented solutions.
**ALWAYS**: Validate that all functionality works as expected before marking tasks complete.

### **📁 File Management Protocol**
**DO NOT**: Create new files when existing files exist which should be updated and/or already have code which should be updated instead of creating new code blocks, functions, modules or files.
**ONLY**: Create new files for new functionality and/or if the design principles and documentation guidance/best practices dictate this.
**ALWAYS**: Ensure that all file names in the codebase describe what the file is for and what it does.
**ALWAYS**: Use descriptive, purposeful file names that clearly indicate functionality.

### **🧹 File Naming Standards**
**DO NOT**: Create files with pointless, useless descriptive words including: "new", "updated", "enhanced", "improved", "fixed", "quick", "simple", "clean", "basic", "comprehensive" or any other meaningless descriptors.
**ALWAYS**: Ensure that all files in the codebase that have pointless, useless descriptive words MUST be renamed, the removed word must not be replaced with a similarly pointless or useless descriptor, and all imports and dependencies must be updated.
**ALWAYS**: Use semantic, functional file names that describe the actual purpose and responsibility.

### **🛡️ Code Integrity Protection (CANONICAL MANDATORY)**
**DO NOT**: BYPASS ANY EXISTING CODE BUSINESS LOGIC OR CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL FILES; USE THE EXISTING CODE AND FILES, IF THERE IS AN ISSUE FIX THE EXISTING CODE AND FILES.
**DO NOT**: POLLUTE OR CREATE ADDITIONAL MESS IN THE CODEBASE.
**ALWAYS**: Maintain existing architectural patterns and business logic.
**ALWAYS**: Refactor and improve existing code rather than working around it.
**ALWAYS**: Follow the principle of least change - make minimal, focused modifications.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to ALL code changes without exception.
**CANONICAL MANDATORY**: Ensure DRY compliance - eliminate any code duplication discovered during development.
